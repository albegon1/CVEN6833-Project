  abstract = {Managers of highway bridge infrastructure constantly seek to improve their predictions of the physical performance of their facilities at any future time and also to identify the influential factors of bridge deterioration. In addressing this subject for concrete superstructures in particular, this paper uses empirical data from Indiana spanning 1992\textendash{}2014. The superstructure design types considered are cast-in-place concrete (slab, stringer, and arch-deck) and prestressed concrete (stringer, T-beam, box-beam multiple, and box-beam single). Exponential and polynomial functional forms are investigated as part of the modeling process. A number of factors are found to have statistically significant influence on the deterioration of the concrete superstructures' physical condition consistently across all design types, and other factors are found to be significant only for some design types. The paper also carries out sensitivity and marginal effects analyses to quantify the strength of effect of the influential factors on superstructure deterioration. Using the developed models, the paper establishes service lives for each concrete superstructure design type and compares the findings with those of past studies. The developed models can help highway agencies to carry out condition-based scheduling of bridge superstructure rehabilitation and reconstruction and to identify the materials and designs that are best suited to specific climates. This is useful for a number of agency processes including work programming and scheduling, and for feedback to bridge designers and maintenance personnel.

  abstract = {In the United States, National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings, since the 1970s, and AASHTO's commonly recognized (CoRe) element condition data, since the 1990s, have provided two major sources of bridge condition data. Although these separate systems of condition assessment had their individual uses, comparing the two, and mapping one from the other had uses for both state and federal agencies and the bridge management community. Alternative methods for this mapping have been proposed in the literature with varying predictive accuracy. With the publication of the new AASHTO Manual for Bridge Element Inspection in 2013, national bridge elements (NBEs) replace the CoRe element condition data as the comparable condition data for the NBI condition ratings. This paper investigates the use of the recursive partitioning method to develop classification trees that predict NBI condition ratings from NBE condition data. On the basis of data from a 2016 submission and 12 transportation agencies, classification trees were developed that presented the most likely NBI condition ratings for a set of logical conditions based on the relative element quantities and the percentage of element quantities in the condition states. The predictive accuracies for the trees are sufficient, and the percentages of exact matches and matches within one error term are better than other studies in the literature. Although the trees can be improved in the future with the availability of more NBE data submissions, the study presented preliminary decision trees with sufficient predictive accuracy that could be adopted by transportation agencies for a variety of bridge management functions.},

  abstract = {We examine the characteristics of 3 day total extreme precipitation in the western United States. Coherent seasonal spatial patterns of timing and magnitude are evident in the data, motivating a seasonally based analysis. Using a clustering method that is consistent with extreme value theory, we identify coherent regions for extremes that vary seasonally. Based on storm back trajectory analysis, we demonstrate unique moisture sources and dominant moisture pathways for each spatial region. In the winter the Pacific Ocean is the dominant moisture source across the west, but in other seasons the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of California, and the land surface over the midwestern U.S. play an important role. We find the El Ni\~no\textendash{}Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to not have a strong impact on dominant moisture delivery pathways or moisture sources. The frequency of extremes under ENSO is spatially coherent and seasonally dependent with certain regions tending to have more (less) frequent extreme events in El Ni\~no (La Ni\~na) conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an improved edition of the climate division dataset for the conterminous United States (i.e., version 2). The first improvement is to the input data, which now include additional station networks, quality assurance reviews, and temperature bias adjustments. The second improvement is to the suite of climatic elements, which now includes both maximum and minimum temperatures. The third improvement is to the computational approach, which now employs climatologically aided interpolation to address topographic and network variability. Version 2 exhibits substantial differences from version 1 over the period 1895\textendash{}2012. For example, divisional averages in version 2 tend to be cooler and wetter, particularly in mountainous areas of the western United States. Division-level trends in temperature and precipitation display greater spatial consistency in version 2. National-scale temperature trends in version 2 are comparable to those in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network whereas version 1 exhibits less warming as a result of historical changes in observing practices. Divisional errors in version 2 are likely less than 0.5$^\circ$C for temperature and 20 mm for precipitation at the start of the record, falling rapidly thereafter. Overall, these results indicate that version 2 can supersede version 1 in both operational climate monitoring and applied climatic research.},
